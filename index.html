          <p id="about"> Pat's Salmon Cookies owners are a family of four, native to Seattle and Pacific Northwest. That means that they eat a lot of salmon, and are usually sun deprived. Pat and Jenny love their coffee, no matter what time of day it is, because it's the only thing that keeps them upbeet in this rainy grey weather. But that’s okay, because our motto is “When life gives you lemons, make lemonade”. Or rather, in our case: when life gives you lots of salmon, make cookies. 
          <br><br>
          Pat's dad was a fisherman, and he sometimes took his little boy on long fishing trips. Pat learned everything about salmon, and as he loved food from the young age, he decided to learn cooking at the Cordon Bleu in Paris, and create a bakery like no others. That's how Pat's Salmon Cookies began.
          <br><br>
          Soon Jenny, an excellent barista and coffee connoisseur, joined him, and now the whole family contributes to the success of Pat's Salmon Cookies.
          And they are a hit, especially in Dubai! </p>
